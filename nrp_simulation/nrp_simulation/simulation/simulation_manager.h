 * Control request methods are processed sequentially guarded by a lock, with the exception of "stopSimulation",
 * which can be processed in parallel.
 *
 * Control requests are forwarded to Implementations of this interface via a set of callbacks. Exceptions occurring
 * in these callbacks are handled by SimulationManager by transitioning the simulation to state "Failed", from which the
 * only possible action is to shutdown the simulation.
