/*!
 * \brief NRP Server class, responsible for handling simulation control requests coming from the client application or script
 *
 * The class has two roles:
 * * receive simulation control requests from the client application
 * * relay received requests to the main thread of NRP Core and wait for response
 *
 * The class is an instance of gRPC Service, which means that it will have a pool of worker threads.
 * Every request coming from the client will be handled by a separate thread from the pool.
 * The natural approach to request handling would be to call proper methods of the SimulationManager directly
 * from the callbacks (for example, SimulationManager::initFTILoop() from NrpCoreServer::init()).
 * This proved to cause problems with certain python libraries, like OpenCV, that may be used in the transceiver functions.
 * The problem seems to arise from the fact, that the python code was executed in a worker thread, and not
 * in the thread that spawned the python interpreter (the main thread of NRP Core). The solution is to create
 * a producer-consumer relation between the NRP Server threads and the main thread. The NRP Server relays (produces)
 * the requests to the main thread, which consumes them and returns a status back to the NRP Server.
