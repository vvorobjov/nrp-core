/*!
 * \brief Manages all simulation data
 *
 * This class is responsible for managing all simulation data. In particular,
 * it manages all DataPacks that are produced during the course of the simulation.
 *
 * The DataPacks are stored in five separate pools:
 * - Engine Pool for DataPacks coming from the Engines
 * - Preprocessing Pool for DataPacks coming from the Preprocessing Functions
 * - Transceiver Pool for DataPacks coming from the Transceiver Functions
 * - External Pool for DataPacks coming from external processes, most likely a Master Script
 * - Trajectory for DataPacks coming from the Status Function
 *
 * The first four pools are meant to store the most recent simulation data coming from various sources.
 * They are implemented as sets, so he DataPacks stored in these pools are overwritten
 * (updated) whenever a new DataPack with matching ID is inserted.
 *
 * The Trajectory is used to store a history of observations produced by the Status Function.
 * It is implemented using a vector, so the order of DataPacks is preserved.
 * The DataPacks from this pool is intended to be sent back to the Master Script whenever
 * the done flag coming from the Status Function is set.
