/*! \page nrp_engines Engine implementations shipped with NRP-core

This page lists \ref engines "Engine" implementations currently available with NRP-core. 
These implementations provide out-of-the-box functionality for use with NRP-core, and also represent good examples to study for users interested in implementing their own engines. 
For each engine implementation, a general description of the provided functionality is offered first, followed by the engine configuration parameters, and finally a list of datapack types supported by the engine.

Additionally, in order to make it easier to implement new engines, we propose a way to leverage code reusability: for new engine implementations, interested users can therefore refer to one of the available \subpage engine_comm "Engine Communication Protocols". These are Engine templates implementing all aspects of engine client / server communication for a given protocol.

List of available engines:

- \subpage gazebo_engine "Gazebo": engine implementation for the <a href="http://gazebosim.org/">Gazebo physics simulator</a>
- \subpage nest_engine "NEST": two different implementations that integrate the <a href="https://www.nest-simulator.org/">NEST Simulator</a> into NRP-core
- \subpage python_json_engine "Python JSON Engine": generic Python-based mechanism that imports and executes a simulator inside a user-defined python script. Ideal for simulators with a Python API.
- \subpage pysim_engine "PySim": engine implementation based on the \ref python_json_engine wrapping different simulators (Mujoco, Opensim and OpenAI) with a python API
- \subpage datatransfer_engine "Data Transfer Engine": engine implementation designed to transfer data from NRP-core experiments to file or the network.
