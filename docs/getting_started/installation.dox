/*! \page installation Installation Instructions

The instructions required to install NRP-core from the source (the only option currently available) are listed below.

\section installation_requirements Requirements

<b>WARNING:</b> Previous versions of the NRP install forked versions of several libraries, particularly NEST and Gazebo. Installing NRP-core in a system where a previous version of NRP is installed is known to cause conflicts. We strongly recommend not to do it.

\subsection os Operative System

NRP-core has only been tested on <b>Ubuntu 20.04</b> at the moment, and therefore this OS and version are recommended. Installation in other environments might be possible but has not been tested yet.

\subsection nest_version NEST

NRP-core only supports <b>NEST 3</b>.

As part of the installation process NEST 3 is built and installed. If you have an existing installation of NEST we recommend you to uninstall it before installing NRP-core. In case you still want to use your installed version, you can avoid the installation process to build and install NEST by changing the value of <i>ENABLE_NEST</i> from <i>FULL</i> to <i>CLIENT</i> in the root CMakeLists.txt file:

\code{.sh}
set(ENABLE_NEST CLIENT)
\endcode

In any case, be aware that NEST 2.x is incompatible with NRP-core.

\section installation_options Common NRP-core CMake options

Here is the list of the CMake options which can help to modify the project configuration (turn on and turn off the support of some components and features).

Developers options:
- <b>COVERAGE</b> enables generation of the code coverage reports during the testing;
- <b>BUILD_RST</b> enables generation of the reStructuredText source files from the Doxygen documentation.

Communication protocols options:
- <b>ENABLE_ROS</b> enables compilation with the ROS support;
- <b>ENABLE_MQTT</b> enables compilation with the MQTT support.

ENABLE_SIMULATOR and BUILD_SIMULATOR_ENGINE_SERVER options:
- <b>ENABLE_NEST</b> and <b>BUILD_NEST_ENGINE_SERVER</b>;
- <b>ENABLE_GAZEBO</b> and <b>BUILD_GAZEBO_ENGINE_SERVER</b>.

The ENABLE_SIMULATOR and BUILD_SIMULATOR_ENGINE_SERVER flags allow to disable the compilation of those parts of nrp-core that depends on or install a specific simulator (eg. gazebo, nest)

The expected behavior for each of these pairs flags is as follows:
- the NRPCoreSim is always built regardless of any of the flags values.
- if ENABLE_SIMULATOR is set to OFF:
  - the related simulator won't be assumed to be installed in the system, ie. make won't fail if it isn't. Also it won't be installed in the compilation process if this possibility is available (as in the case of nest)
  - The engines connected with this simulator won't be built (nor client nor server components)
  - tests that would fail if the related simulator is not available won't be built
- if the ENABLE_SIMULATOR is set to ON and BUILD_SIMULATOR_ENGINE_SERVER is set to OFF: Same as above, but:
  - the engine clients connected to this simulator will be built. This means that they should not depend on or link to any specific simulator
  - the engine server side components might or might not be built, depending on if the related simulator is required at compilation time
- if the both flags are set to ON the simulator is assumed to be installed or it will be installed from source if this option is available. All targets connected with this simulator will be built

This flag system allows to configure the resulting nrp-core depending on which simulators are available on the system, both for avoiding potential dependency conflicts between simulators and enforcing modularity, opening the possibility of having specific engine servers running on a different machine or inside containers.

\section installation_environment Setting the environment

In order to properly set the environment to run experiments with NRP-core, please make sure to add the lines below to your ~/.bashrc file
\skip Start of setting environment
\until End of setting environment

\section installation_sim Steps for installing additional simulators
This section includes installation steps for simulators that may be used with \ref python_json_engine and \ref pysim_engine.
The \ref pysim_engine "PySim engine" allows to connect a set of simulators with Python interfaces with NRP-Core, these include OpenAI Gym, Mujoco, and OpenSim.

\subsection installation_sim_tvb Installation of The Virtual Brain

The instructions below install TVB root and data directly from git repositiories.
It is also possible to install them via pip, but then certain features and data sets may not be accessible.
Complete instructions can be found at <a href="https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-root">tvb-root</a> and <a href="https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-data">tvb-data</a>
repository pages.

\code{.sh}
# Install a tool that aliases python3 as python. Needed for TVB installation
sudo apt install python-is-python3

# TVB data
mkdir $HOME/tvb
cd $HOME/tvb
git clone https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-data.git
cd tvb-data
sudo python3 setup.py develop

# TVB root
cd $HOME/tvb
git clone https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-root.git
