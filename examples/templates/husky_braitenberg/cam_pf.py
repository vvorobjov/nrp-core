    Performs a very simple image detection as used in the Braitenberg demo.
    Copied and modified from original NRP, see hbp_nrp_cle/hbp_nrp_cle/tf_framework/tf_lib.py

    :param camera: The DataPack containing the image to process
    :returns: A JsonDataPack with three properties:
        - *left*: This is the percentage of red pixels in the left half of the image
        - *right*: This is the percentage of red pixels in the right half of the image
        - *go_on*: This is the percentage of non-red pixels of the overall image

    :example: A completely red image (255,0,0) results in (1,1,0)
    :example: A completely yellow image (255,255,0) results in (0,0,1)

    The lightest color that is recognized as red is (255,127,127).
