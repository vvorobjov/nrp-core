/*!
 * /brief Class implementing a computation graph
 *
 * In the context of nrp-core a computation graph is defined as a directed, acyclic property graph in which nodes are associated
 * to objects of type ComputationalNode and which implements a 'compute' method. Nodes use Ports to communicate with each other.
 * Nodes are uniquely identified in the graph by an 'id' attribute which is of type string. Edges in the graph represent
 * connections between nodes, ie. between ports in the source and target nodes.
 *
 * Nodes can be of three types: 'Input', 'Output' and 'Functional'. 'Input' nodes can only be source nodes in edges.
 * 'Output' nodes can only be target nodes in edges. 'Functional' nodes can be both source and target.
 *
 * The graph itself implements a 'compute' function which calls 'compute' on all the nodes in the graph in the right order.
 * The latter is defined as follows: within a graph 'compute' operation, a node must always be executed after all the
 * source nodes in edges for which the former is target.
 *
 * The former definition on the execution order allows to divide the graph in layers which must be executed sequentially.
 * Nodes in each layer can be executed in parallel.
 *
 * The first layer will always be composed of nodes which have no inputs. These include 'Input' nodes and 'Functional'
 * with no inputs. For convenience, the latter are moved to the second layer (with no consequences) and the first
 * layer is kept with 'Input' nodes only.
 * In the same way, all 'Output' nodes are moved to a separate layer which is executed the last.
